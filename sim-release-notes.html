<body><h1>Welcome to the Cajeput pre-release</h1>

<p>This software is highly experimental, for testing purposes only, and not release-worthy. Most of the features you'd expect to have - inventory, teleportation and region crossing, even objects - are not implemented yet.</p>

<p>If you wish to leave the region, please logout and log back in somewhere else. (You <em>should</em> be logged out cleanly, though this also means that you'll return here if you just log in at your previous location.)</p>

<h2>Currently supported:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Teleports into the region (mostly)</li>
  <li>Logging into the region directly (again, mostly)</li>
  <li>Logging out cleanly</li>
  <li>Chat</li>
  <li>Movement (sort of, badly)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Still to do</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Prims - creation, deletion, sending to viewer</li>
  <li>Texture downloads</li>
  <li>Texture and asset uploads</li>
  <li>Teleporting out of the region</li>
  <li>Mapping and search</li>
  <li>Proper throttling of outgoing packets</li>
  <li>Instant messaging</li>
  <li>and a thousand other things...</li>
</ul>
