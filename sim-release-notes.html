<body><h1>Welcome to the Cajeput pre-release</h1>

<p>This software is highly experimental, for testing purposes only, and not release-worthy. Most of the features you'd expect to have are incomplete or not implemented yet.</p>

<h2>Currently supported:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Teleports into the region, and even out (most of the time), as well as direct logins</li>
  <li>Logging out cleanly (though <em>without saving attachments</em>, so be careful)</li>
  <li>Chat, including chat from (though <em>not</em> to) objects</li>
  <li>Avatar movement (including most of the animations)</li>
  <li>Some very basic and buggy LSL scripting support</li>
</ul>
<h2>Still to do</h2>
<ul>
  <li>For some reason, if you teleport into Cajeput from an OpenSim region and then back to the original region, the original OpenSim region does a RequestTeleportToLocation back into the Cajeput region - which breaks the viewer! This isn't Cajeput-specific, though - it looks like OpenSim is known to have issues in this area.</li>
  <li>Finish teleport/enter region, so that it puts you in the correct location</li>
  <li>Teleport home/to landmark</li>
  <li>Finish inventory</li>
  <li>Debug texture downloads and prioritise correctly</li>
  <li>Finish texture and asset uploads</li>
  <li>Finish/debug mapping</li>
  <li>Search, user profiles, etc</li>
  <li>Proper throttling of outgoing packets</li>
  <li>Instant messaging</li>
  <li>Finish animation support</li>
  <li>and a thousand other things...</li>
</ul>
