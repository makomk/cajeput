The Cajeput LSL compiler and VM
===============================

Cajeput uses a custom-developed compiler and virtual machine to run LSL scripts. This document will explain how it works and how to extend it.

Adding new LSL functions
------------------------
See HACKING.LSL. You may also wish to add broadly useful functions that aren't dependent on the rest of Cajeput, such as list manipulation, to the core VM in caj_vm.cpp. In this case, the call to vm_world_add_func goes in vm_world_new.

Some functions are actually implemented as LSL opcodes. See the next section for details.

Adding new LSL opcodes
----------------------

Edit opcode_data.txt, then modify step_script to implement the new opcode. For iteroperability reasons, please co-ordinate any opcode additions with me. 

BIG FAT WARNING:
You can abort execution by jumping to abort_exec, but be sure to make sure that the stack is in the same state as it would be if the opcode had executed normally. (Exception: pointers may be NULL, which isn't allowed in normal execution.) Also make sure that any reference counts are correct.

TODO. Use the source, Luke.

Tracevals
---------
Tracevals are a clever way of unwinding the stack if an exception occurs or we need to serialise a script that's currently running. Possibly too clever.

Every single instruction in the code has a traceval associated with it, which describes the contents of the stack after it's popped its arguments and before it's pushed its results. 

The traceval doesn't describe the contents of the stack directly; instead it contains two things:
 - the address of the instruction that pushed the topmost stack item
 - the number of stack items pushed by that instruction that are still on
   the stack.

Because the stack is accessed in a strictly last-in, first-out order, this is enough to reconstruct the entire stack contents.

For example, take the following code:

double(string msg, integer value) {
   llOwnerSay(msg+(2*value));
}

This might compile to:
xx: instruction     | traceval
01: BEGIN_CALL      | 0x0000, 2
02: RDL_P 3         | 0x0001, 1
03: RDG_I 0         | 0x0002, 1
04: RDL_I 4         | 0x0003, 1
05: MUL_II          | 0x0002, 1
06: CAST_I2S        | 0x0002, 1
07: ADD_SS          | 0x0001, 1
08: CALL llOwnerSay | 0x0000, 2
09: DROP_I          | 0x0000, 1
0A: DROP_P          | 0x0000, 0
0B: RET             | 0x0000, 0

Suppose the current IP is 0x0002, and we want to know the types on the stack. The traceval is [0x0001, 1], which means the topmost item was pushed by 0001: BEGIN_CALL and and is a RET_ADDR. Its traceval is [0x0000, 2], which means the next things are the bottommost two items from the function arguments: an INT and a STR. So the stack looks like this:
(top) RET_ADDR INT STR (caller's address) ...

Now, suppose that the current IP is instead 0x0006. Firstly, we note that CAST_I2S pops an INT from the stack that isn't included in its traceval. So the topmost item is an INT. Then we follow the tracevals back:

06: [0x0002, 1] -> 02: RDL_P -> PTR on stack
02: [0x0001, 1] -> 01: BEGIN_CALL -> RET_ADDR on stack
01: [0x0000, 2] -> arguments -> INT, STR on stack

This means the final stack contents are:
(top) INT PTR RET_ADDR INT STR (caller's address) ...
